The Picture of Dorian Gray

The Preface


The artist is the creator of beautiful things.To reveal art and conceal the artist is art’s aim.The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a newmaterial his impression of beautiful things.

The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.
